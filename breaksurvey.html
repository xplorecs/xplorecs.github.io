<h1>Pre-Break Survey</h1>
<p>Summary of responses to the <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/pz4Cl0cLaR">Pre-Break Survey</a></p>
<h4>How is the class going so far?</h4>
<p>Too slow: 0<br />
A little too slow: 1<br />
(Write-in) On the right pace: 1<br />
(Write-in) Just good: 1<br />
A little too fast: 9<br />
Too fast: 5<br />
Way too fast!: 4  </p>
<p>(There are 11 people in the class who didn't submit any survey, which I
guess I should interpret as "Too slow".)</p>
<div class="answer">

<p>This is about what I expected, and probably means things are a bit too
fast.  I intentionally don't include an option on this question for
"just right", since its too easy to click that (and highly unlikely the
pace could be just right for more than a very few people), and I want to
make people think more about their answers.</p>
<p>One thing I hope to enable with the Tae Kwon Do-style grading is for the
course pace to be more variable to fit different students better.  But,
I still don't know a way to do this with only one class meeting and no
good way to sub-divide (unlike what is done in my daughter's Tae Kwon Do
classes, where the 2-3 instructors can split up the 8-12 students into
smaller groups based on their levels at different points during the
class).  If anyone has any suggestions for how to do something like this
in our class, I would love to hear them!
   </div></p>
<h4>Will you be at class Friday?</h4>
<p>Yes: 12<br />
Yes, in person, but my mind will be elsewhere: 5<br />
No, unless we have a super-important required activity: 1<br />
No, no matter what: 4  </p>
<p>(I'm interpreting the 11 people in the class who didn't submit any
survey, as most likely "No, unless we have a super-important required
activity" based on their non-responses.)</p>
<p><div class="answer"> </p>
<p>Looks like enough people will be here that we should have class Friday,
but we'll make it a question and answer class rather than covering any
new topics.</p>
<p>I should probably do a survey to find out how many people are "Yes, in
person, but my mind will be elsewhere" on most days!  In general, if you
are not in a state where you can be focused in class and get something
out of it (and contribute something to it), its better if you get some
sleep instead of coming to class.  </p>
<p>I hope everyone finds classes worthwhile and try to make them as
engaging and useful as I can, but I think you should have a good enough
idea what to expect in most classes and what is the most valuable way to
use your time to make smart decisions yourself if it is worthwhile to
come.
   </div></p>
<h4>What topics would you like to see in the rest of the class? (Check all that you want)</h4>
<p>Artificial Intelligence: 17<br />
Computer Security: 16<br />
More on Encryption: 9<br />
Web Applications: 8<br />
Other programming Languages: 7<br />
Internet: 6<br />
More about how Computers Work (hardware): 5<br />
Fundamental questions about computing: 5<br />
History of Computing: 3  </p>
<p><strong>Other suggestions:</strong> quantum computing, games, data analysis/manipulation,
philosophy of computing, finance applications</p>
<h4>What have you found disappointing about the class so far?</h4>
<p><em>(Below are all the comments recieved, with my responses to some of them.)</em></p>
<p><div class="question">
The class is interesting but the opportunity cost of the projects to my
other classes has been rough at times.
   </div>
   <div class="question">
Office hours are not always helpful in solving problems with my code.
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
   Sorry to hear that!  That said, you shouldn't expect office hours to
   be mainly for "solving problems with your code" - the focus should be
   more on helping you understand the underlying concepts and what is
   going on so that you are able to solve problems yourself.</p>
<p>The office hours in the day or two before assignments are due are
   usually crowded so there isn't enough time for everyone.  The office
   hours that are not right before deadlines are often much less
   crowded, with enough time to really go through things and hopefully
   understand. So, if not getting enough time for all your questions to
   be answered well is the problem, I definitely recommend coming to the
   earlier office hours!
   </div>
   <div class="question">
Haven't perfectly understood how language is actually implemented in computing 
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
   This isn't expected yet, but later in the semester you'll implement
   your own interpreter, so will understand everything about how
   programs execute (at least down to a certain abstraction level).
   </div>
   <div class="question">
Just a couple of times I feel like some important topics from either the
textbook or online weren't really explained fully in class
   </div>
   <div class="answer"></p>
<p>I'm surprised it isn't more often - there are lots of important
   topics in the textbook and online that we don't have time to cover in
   class.  I try to focus the class time on the things that are both
   most important and benefit most from in-class presentation (e.g., I
   believe things like Python programming constructs are much better
   learned from the on-line course, so don't spend much time on them in
   class; more abstract things like the <span
   class="math">&Theta;</span> notation are better learned by reading
   the coursebook (although worth spending some time in class).</p>
<p>That said, if there are things covered in the on-line course or
   coursebook that you think are important, but are confusing or need
   more explanation, make sure to ask about them so I know to cover them
   in class.
   </div>
   <div class="question">
The only problem i encountered was on the projects not all of the
problems have test cases for us to know if our code on that part of the
problem is really working or not.  A example of that is on project 3 we
don't have a test case involving the offshoot to see if our offshoot
part of the program is right on the rewrite function and neither for the
flatten_commands function. 
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
This is a good point, and I've provided some test cases for most of the
problems in Project 4.  As you develop as a programmer, though, you'll
realize that part of being a great software developer is being able to
come up with good test cases.  This requires thinking about the unusual
inputs where a program might misbehave, and designing test cases to
cover those.  So, although I've tried to provide fairly comprehensive
test cases for Project 4, for some of the later projects it will be
important for you to be able to think of both good strategies for
testing your code, and specific test cases on your own.
   </div>
   <div class="question">
Great class, I'm loving it
   </div>
   <div class="question">
I feel like the Projects and the content of lectures are very
disconnected from one another.
   </div>
   <div class="question">
I would like the examples we do in class are is being taught in class to
be very helpful for the coming up projects.
   </div>
   <div class="question">
I feel like what we do in lecture doesn't really prepare us for
projects. I'm also not really confident about recursive functions.
   </div>
   <div class="question">
I find the lectures interesting but occasionally I struggle to see how
they connect to the projects which can be frustrating.
   <div class="question"> 
Often times I struggle to see how the lectures relate to the projects.
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
A comon theme in many comments is about lectures not preparing you to do
the projects.  This is understandable, but I think stems mostly from
having the wrong expectations.</p>
<p>One thing I think you are expecting from other courses is the model
where lectures introduce material and are supposed to cover everything
you need to know to do the homeworks, homework assignments reinforce it
and make sure people are attending class, and then exams test if you
remember it.  In my view, this is not a good model, but it is
understandable that you are expecting this based on the prevailing
experience you have had in dozens of previous courses, and frustrated
when it the way the class works is different from your expectations.</p>
<p>In my view, the opposite model makes a lot more sense: projects
introduce material, and then lectures use that basis to provide more
conceptual depth and context.  </p>
<p>What we do in this class is a bit more of a hybrid &mdash; some concepts
are introduced in lectures, and others are introduced in the
projects. In my view, lectures (especially in-person ones) are a
horrible medium for covering technical material.  I agree with Robert
Talbert's description here that there are some things <a href="http://chronicle.com/blognetwork/castingoutnines/2012/02/13/four-things-lecture-is-good-for/">lectures are good
for</a>:
<em>modeling thought processes</em>, <em>sharing cognitive structures</em>, <em>giving
context</em>, and <em>telling stories</em> (I would add <em>building community</em> to his
list), but they are not a good medium at all for <em>information transfer</em>
or <em>covering material</em>.  (At least according to Talbert, my cs101
lectures, at least, <a href="http://chronicle.com/blognetwork/castingoutnines/2012/04/03/udacity-cs101-whats-been-good/">focus on doing the right things in
lecture</a>.)</p>
<p>You shouldn't expect the lectures to cover everything you need to do the
projects, or that everything in lectures connects closely with the
projects.  That said, most of the things we do in class do
connect to the projects, often quite directly.  But, sometimes it is
left up to you to figure out the connections. (Other times, like when we
did <code>list_flatten</code>, the connection is meant to be obvious and directly
helpful for a particular project problem.)<br />
   </div>
   <div class="question">
"more news/broad learning about machines and role in world/applications
to real life would be great.  also the reading plus the udacity videos
is a lot of work outside of class that arent deliverables.</p>
<p>i like the class a lot on the whole. "
    </div>
   <div class="question">
I found out the classes are too short. :(
   </div>
   <div class"answer">
At least for the videos, you can watch at 1/2 speed if you want them to be longer. I'm not sure how to do this for the in-person classes, though. ;)<br />
   </div>
   <div class="question">
n/a
   </div>
   <div class"answer">
I'm not sure I understand what "n/a" means, but in future surveys please remember the <a href="pledge.html">course pedge</a> you signed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will provide useful feedback. I realize that this is a new and experimental course, and it is important that I let the course staff know what they need to improve the course. I will not wait until the end of the course to make the course staff aware of any problems. I will provide feedback either anonymously or by contacting the course staff directly. I will fill out all requested surveys honestly and thoroughly.
   </div>
   <div class="question">
That I'm learning more from the online course and doing the projects
than in class
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
This is what I would expect, so I don't think it should be disappointing
(unless you think its a problem that you are paying tuition, but the
things you are learning most from are available to anyone in the world
for free; but, you should view the main thing you are paying tuition for
is to be part of a community and to have direct access to the people in
it (including, but certinaly not limited to, me and Yuchi, for this
course).  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of this should be because of the time you are spending on them,
which I expect is more total time on the on-line course and projects,
than you are spending in class. But, it may also be because the
person-effort-per-minute that went into producing the on-line course is
about 10-100 times what they are for the in-person classes, which
hopefully does make it better than the lectures.
   </div>
   <div class="question">
I have been disappointed in the differences between class, projects, and
online lessons. I am able to understand with some difficulty the online
lessons, however class is more confuses me more than clarifies aspects
of projects/online lessons. The expectations for the projects are so
high that it seems like the only way to succeed is to go to office
hours, rather than look online or at class notes or the python manual. I
REALLY loved the outlook of the class in January, how more focus would
be on thinking and problem solving and understanding computers, however
I feel like the actual path of the curriculum has not been consistent
with the initial message.
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
I think both of your points are good, but also a bit contradictory
(either that, or I'm not understanding them well, and would encourage
you to come to office hours or arrange another time to talk).  The
expectations for the projects are high because they "focus on thinking
and problem solving and understanding computers", not on things you
could do just by repeating what you've seen in class or the on-line
materials.  I do, though, plan to get more into deeper issues in problem
solving and understanding computers later in the course, now that
everyone (hopefully!) has a strong foundation to build on.
   </div>
   <div class="question">
projects have been a little diifficult
   </div>
   <div class="question">
Nothing really. I really like this class in general. It is very
interesting and makes me really think!
   </div>
   <div class="question">
If you come to class with no expectations or with a pessimist attitude,
you will only be met with pleasant surprises or met expectations.
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
The optimist is always happy and hopeful, but nearly always
disappointed; the pessimist is grumpy and sad, but nearly always right.
Best to folow Alan Kay's advice an invent the future you want, and then
you can be both an optimist and right.
   </div>
   <div class="question">
I really enjoy the class, but I think the class is going a little too
fast. Most of the time (especially during last few lectures), it is very
hard for me to understand what is discussed in lectures. I hope that we
spend enough time on basics before going on to complex
concepts. Projects are really challenging (sometimes very difficult),
but I think office hours are very helpful.
   </div>
   <div class="question">
For me, getting the problem sets done on time have been a major
challenge. I feel as though I am learning a ton, but I am really having
to struggle to finish things.
   <div class="question">
   </div>
I don't think I have learned anything in person. Most of what I have
learned has been at home. I am not very good at piecing together the
basics because I don't feel motivated learning in the stale youtube
world, which is why I am so behind.
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
I totally understand not wanting to watch videos - I feel the same
way. One option is to read the notes instead (see
<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs101/">Notes</a> for links to notes for
all the cs101 units).  I think it probably works best to read the notes,
try the quizzes on-line, and only watch the videos when you can't get
things from the notes.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't know a way to make the in-person classes
substantially better.  I do try, of course, and am open to any
suggestions you have about what would make them better for you (but with
the constraint that they can't make things a lot worse for everyone else
in the class), but its unlikely that if they have not been working well
for you so far that they will suddenly start to work better.  So, take
the time you are spending in class to do other things that will be more
effective.  There are lots and lots of other ways to learn the core
material in this class; find what works best for you, and don't spend
time on things that clearly are not working.<br />
   </div> 
   <div class="question"> 
This class is not made for a student that has to
simultaneously work. I want to put in more but I don't have the time or
availability to come to office hours because I need to work 20+ hours to
cover my rent, utilities and food. The content is great, but it's not
feasible for me to work as quickly as is demanded. I appreciate the belt
system for that.
   </div> 
   <div class="answer"> </p>
<p>I think, UVA in general, is design for full-time students and not
well-suited to students who have to work as well.  I have huge
admiration for anyone who can manage to work their way through college,
and its great that you are doing this.</p>
</div>

<h4>What would you like to be different about the rest of the class (from how things have been so far)?</h4>
<p><div class="question"> 
Things have been good but a little vague at times. I feel like this has been someone by design however.
   </div>
   <div class="question"> 
Maybe do a quick review of audacity lessons.
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
That's "Udacity" (see <a href="http://blog.udacity.com/2013/02/cs101-one-year-later.html">this blog
post</a> for how
Udacity got its horrible name).</p>
<p>I'm happy to answer any questions about this, or go over things you want
explained in them, but you need to ask me to do this.  Its enough to
just ask, "please explain section 3.12 in class", if you don't know how
to forumlate a specific question, but without this I am not likely to go
over things in the on-line course since I mostly agree with how things
are covered in it.
   </div>
   <div class="question"> 
Include test cases on all of the problems on a project and talk about classes and dictionaries on python.
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
Yes, we've been avoiding classes so far, but will get to them later.
I've started using dictionaries in code examples, but haven't explained
them yet, but will do so soon.
   </div>
   <div class="question"> 
I like how we have projects and ways to get a "belt" if we turn things in late. 
   </div>
   <div class="question"> 
I would to have one project where I write 100% of the code so that I understand exactly what is going on.
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
You will mostly do this for <a href="project4.html">Project 4</a> (other than providing
some tedious code), and if you make it to the "Black Belt" project, that
will be entirely up to you (both to figure out what to do, and there
won't be any starting code).
   </div>
   <div class="question"> 
"Maybe more dynamic questions, like poll questions instead of asking if anybody knows something.
I think everybody would pay more attention."
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
Do you mean in slack or in class?  I tried a poll in slack, but got very
few responses.  I can do hand-raising polls in class (unfortunately, our
attempt to use a secure computation protocol to do a privacy-preserving
poll didn't go so well!)
   </div>
   <div class="question"> 
I would like to learn more stuff regarding the projects prior to having to complete the coding for them.
   </div>
   <div class="question"> 
I would like more consistency and connection between the online lessons, class time, and the projects. The past two weeks have been especially confusing with list_map, list_accumulator, list_mapper, mapper, etc. I feel like if more time was spent on "this does this", "when I type out this here, it is now using this", I would have better understood the last two weeks. I am not asking for things to be simpler or for my hand to be held, I just would like more correlation and explanation. 
   </div>
   <div class="question"> 
maybe do more examples of computing in class
   </div>
   <div class="question"> 
"For projects, to give more expressions to test and what these tests should output. It was difficult to solve some problems, if you do not know exactly how to test them. Some questions could use a little more explanations. </p>
<p>One time, for example Class 14, I was very confused. I think if the material is complex, maybe it is better to use simpler expressions to explain difficult material. "
   </div>
   <div class="answer"> 
The best way to get me to slow down is to ask questions!  There were
some slides in Class 14 with lots of code you weren't expected to
understand completely, but you should feel free to always interrupt
class to ask about anything.
   </div>
   <div class="question">
Maybe more smaller homeworks for more practice? That might not go over very well but it will allow you to know that we understand the different parts of python and topics from the lecture as well as further cementing these ideas for us. That way you can also receive constant feedback on the speed of the class. Also, if they're physical worksheets then they will promote lecture attendance.
   </div>
   <div class="answer"> 
There are tons of practice problems in the Udacity course, including
optional extra homework sets for most of the early units.  We don't want
to spend a lot of time grading so aren't assigning lots of homeworks,
but you can find plenty of problems to do on your own, and I'm happy to explain any questions you have about them.
   </div>
   <div class="question">
I really like the idea of belt promotion system. I can really put in best efforts without worrying too much about grades. I also like that most of our belt promotions are based on projects instead of tests in that if I put in enough efforts I can get good results. I hope that rest of our belt promotions were in forms of projects rather than tests.
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
Awesome!  There will be a test as part of the Blue Belt promotion, and I
think its important to be able to check what people can do on their own
and to answer questions that don't fit into the projects.
   </div>
   <div class="question">
Less reliance on Udacity would be cool. I don't really like how I'm kinda doing "two" classes for this course.
   </div>
   <div class="question">
More time to do the problem sets. 
   </div>
   <div class="question">
More help session in class before starting other things, sometimes I come in, and I don't really understand the lesson even if I watch or read the chapter/unit. 
   </div>
   <div class="question">
If we actually code in class and try things out, I think it would help to keep us engaged.
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
I've tried this a few times with worksheets and giving people time to
work on solving problems themselves, but don't think its worked well
enough to be worth spending more class time on this.<br />
    </div></p>
<h4>Anything else you would like to say or ask?</h4>
<p><div class="question">
I'm not feeling so motivated to go through the online part of the course
since it is not so related to what we are talking about in class, but I
will eventually have to go over them because they are needed to complete
projects so they are kind of stressful to me.
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
I'm not really getting this (but maybe its related to the different
expectations about how lectures-projects-materials are supposed to
relate).  The on-line lessons are relevant if they are "needed to
complete projects", but this shouldn't be stressful (unless you wait too
late to start!).  It should be pretty clear what parts of the Udacty
course you are expected to do before doing the projects.
   </div>
   <div class="question">
I think the projects are really difficult and very time consuming. A lot
of the projects are things that are barely demonstrated in class, and in
order for me to do the projects I have to use google, or go to the TA's
and ask people who are majoring in computer science. For an introductory
class, it's really difficult for me, maybe it's because I can't think
logically, but I feel really stressed because of this class.
   </div>
   <div class="question">
Yuchi is very helpful in office hours and I can't thank him enough for
his help. The class has been very interesting so far and although I have
some questions about what my actual grade is I am excited for the second
half of the class.
   </div>
   <div class="question">
I want to say that I really enjoyed the message you put forth in the
beginning of the year. I love the belt system and your belief in that
traditional CS courses haven't been getting the job done and you wanted
to provide something different. I personally would like the rest of the
class to be more informative and applicable. I don't see myself taking
another CS course at the University, however would love to leave CS 1120
feeling like I know what goes on inside my computer, in the programming
world, with the internet and the deep web, and like I have some coding
experience, whether it's useful or not.
   </div>
   <div class="question">
N/A 
   </div>
   <div class="question">
I hope that the due date for project 4 is pushed back just a little. We
do have plenty of time until the due date, but since it is spring break,
there will be not be enough office hours to attend do. I hope that the
due date is pushed back to allow time for getting some help.
   </div>
   <div class="question">
The Udacity course takes up an enormous amount of time to complete, and
that is where we have to learn everything from. I understand the concept
of a flipped classroom, but I feel like the three hours spent in class
per week is when I should be learning, not having to go to class for
three hours, and then spend at least four hours extra trying to teach
myself something, with another hour of reading the textbook, and then
stressing out about having to do the Projects, which I think I spent 10
hours in office hours to be able to complete.
