<h1>Questions and Answers</h1>
<p>Here are my answers to the questions you asked on the registration
survey.  If you think of questions that were not asked, feel free to
send them later (you can just send them to me buy email, which can be
anonymous if you want the question to be anonymous).</p>

<p><div class="question">
I'm thinking about writing my thesis about the interface problem - which
is something I initially discovered in a philosophy class "The
Computational Age". I hope to gain more direction on that topic.<br />
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
This sounds interesting, but I don't know what it is &mdash; hope you
will explain it to us!</p>
<p>In general, interfaces are a big challenge in computing.  To make
systems secure and robust, we want their interfaces to be narrow (that
is, they can only do a small set of things, and there is a limited way
of requesting them); to be powerful and general, we want universal
interfaces (like programming languages) that an be used to do anything.
   </div></p>
<p><div class="question">
I want to learn more about languages conceptually so that I have an
easier time learning them on my own - with my eventual goal of making an
app of some kind (probably a game).<br />
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
You'll definitely learn enough in this class to be able to do that, as
well as gain experience in learning (and even implementing) programming
languages.  We won't get into the mechanics of how you actually deploy
an app on iOS or Android, but you will have a chance to build web
applications, and would be able to learn how to make a mobile app on
your own based on what you learn in this class.
   </div></p>
<p><div class="question">
What are specific options for careers I could have in the field of computer science?
   </div>
   <div class="answer"></p>
<p>Computer science is excellent preparation for a wide range of careers.
I know of recent CS majors who have gone on to build companies, law
school, medical school, government, teaching, and consulting.  The most
direct careers are in software development (about 40% of CS majors go
into software development jobs), but there are lots of possibilities.</p>
<p>For UVA computer science graduates, UVA Magazine has a nice
visualization of where students go after graduation: <a href="http://uvamagazine.org/articles/two_roads_diverged_in_a_wood"><em>Two Roads Diverged in a Wood</em></a>

   </center>
   </div></p>
<p><div class="question"> What languages will we be introduced to?</div>
   <div class="answer"> 
   The main language we will use for the course is Python, a programming
   language that is named after Monty Python's Flying Circus.  It is a
   popular choice for introductory programming courses because of its
   simplicity, but also widely used in industry because of its
   expressiveness and widespread support.  We will also learn about and
   see examples in several other languages, including Scheme (which is
   the language used by the first ten chapters of the coursebook).  For
   the Red Belt level, you will implement an interpreter in Python that
   can execute programs in a Scheme-like language.
   </div></p>
<p><div class="question">
   How many hours a week outside of class should I expect to work for this class?
   </div>
   <div class="answer"> </p>
<p>Like most things, what you get out of this course will depend greatly
   on what you put into it.  As a 3-unit course, the course is supposed
   to involve 9 hours of academic work per week (which means 6.5 hours
   of work per week outside of class, assuming you are coming to all the
   classes and they count as academic work, which is sometimes
   questionable!).  My intent is to design the course so that typical
   students will be able to succeed in it without working more than this
   amount (although working really means "working", in a focused and
   effective way during that time).  </p>
<p>That said, I don't think any
   students in cs1120 are "typical".  Some students may find it
   necessary to put in considerably more work than this to succeed in
   the course, and others will (hopefully) find the material and
   assignments so engrossing and enchating that you will be tempted to
   spend all of your time on them (perhaps to the detriment of other
   responsibilities).  You should let me know if you feel like you are
   spending an unreasonable amount of time on the course (either because
   you find it necessary to succeed, or becuase you are becoming
   dangerously addicted to computing), but also keep in mind that many
   of the major assignments in this course are scheduled for two weeks
   so if you don't do any work on them for the first week, you should
   not be surprised if you need to spend 13+ hours on them the second
   week.
   </div></p>
<p><div class="question">
   If I am not the best at math, will I struggle? I am a hard worker and incredibly intelligent, but math is a very uncomfortable zone for me. 
   </div>
   <div class="answer"></p>
<p>First, I question the premise &mdash; math isn't something people are
   inherently good or bad at, but something everyone can learn and
   improve at.  People often struggle with math because they never
   recover from bad early experiences, and approach new math with fear
   and intrepidation instead of optimism and excitement. If certain
   early concepts are not learned well then everything that builds on
   them seems confusing and disconcerting.  Smart and hard-working
   students can often find ways to get through math classes despite
   this, but without fixing the mental blocks that prevent everything
   from making sense as a whole find things to be much harder and less
   enlightening than they should be.  (For more views on this, see
   <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/life/classes/2015/09/why_am_i_bad_at_math_take_a_math_class_in_college_and_learn_to_reason_abstractly.html"><em>Youâ€™re Not Actually Bad at
   Math</em></a>
   (Slate, 3 September 2015) and <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/10/the-myth-of-im-bad-at-math/280914/"><em>The Myth of 'I'm Bad at
   Math'</em></a>
   (The Atlantic, 28 October 2013).)</p>
<p>All that said, the math that is used in computing is quite different
   from most of the math you have encountered so far.  In particular, we
   focus on <em>discrete math</em> (that is, math involving whole numbers),
   wheras most of math after about fourth grade (in the US) is dominated
   by <em>continuous math</em> (real numbers, as used in trigonometry,
   calculus, etc.).  We also focus on using math as a tool for insight,
   not as a goal in itself.  Often, there are many ways to gain the same
   insight, and the power of computing can enable us to gain keener
   insights with simple math than would be obtained using complex math
   without computing.
   </div></p>
<p><div class="question">
   Is there any supplemental material that I can add to improve my coding ability?
   </div>
   <div class="answer"></p>
<p>In general, the best way to improve one's programming ability is to
   attempt to solve problems just at the edge of your ability so you
   keep pushing yourself to learn new things, and then to work with
   mentors that are a level or two about you to learn new tricks and
   better ways to do things.</p>
<p>There are tons of great, free materials for learning programming.
   Different things work best for different people, so I'm wary of
   giving any specific recommendations, but some resources that many
   people find useful (and I think are mostly good) are:</p>

<p><div class="question">
   As a third year I was curious as to why it was originally restricted to 1st and 2nd year students.
   </div>
   <div class="answer"></p>
<p>The real question should be why is course enrollment done by
   senority!  </p>
<p>It is much more important that first year students get the courses they
   want, since they can impact what they do the rest of their time at
   the University (not to mention after that).  By the time someone is a
   3rd or 4th year, the potential impact of a class is much less (there
   are, of course, exceptions, and plenty of students don't really
   figure out what they want to do until their 4th year, but it is a lot
   tought to work out a different plan at that stage).  The other reason
   early students should have priority is that by their 3rd year,
   students should have either learned on their own or hopefully both
   built strong enough relationships with some faculty to be able to get
   good advice on how to get what you want.  I don't know of any case
   where a third-year student who really wanted into a course and did
   all the right things to make that happen wasn't able to get into the
   course they wanted, but it is much less fair to expect a first-year
   student to be confident and savvy enough to expect to be able to bend
   the rules.</p>
<p>Hence, the only way I could figure out with SIS to override the
   backwards system that is used for default registration, was to limit
   the class to 1st and 2nd years, until they had a fair chance to
   register.  If the University switches to a reverse-seniority
   registration system, I won't need to have any restrictions.
   </div></p>
<p><div class="question">
   I would like to know how much of a mastery we are expected to gain for programming. 
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
   At least the way I define "mastery", it is something that takes a
   lifetime.  So, I wouldn't expect anyone to master programming in a
   one-semester course.  Everyone should, though, get to the level where
   you can write moderately complex programs on your own that solve
   interesting problems, and can reason about what they do when they are
   executed.
   </div></p>
<p><div class="question">
   Will I build a search engine? 
   </div>
   <div class="answer"></p>
<p>By the end of the lessons in the Udacity cs101 course (which we'll
   finish around spring break), you'll have built a web crawler and
   back-end to a search engine (what is needed to build an index of the
   web, and to respond to search queries), but won't have done the
   mechanics of making a web front-end to your search engine so it can
   run as a web app (accepting queries from a web browser).  If you
   reach the Black Belt level in the course, you will build a web
   application and know everything you need to put a fully-functional
   and useful search enging on the web.
   </div></p>
<p><div class="question">
   Does Professor Evans have another CS class that I can take next semester?
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
   You should make sure you like this one first!</p>
<p>Our department doesn't decide on courses until usually the week the
   course listings are needed by the University (or often, until several
   weeks after that).  So, I have no idea what I'm teaching next
   semester, but will let you know when I do.

<p><div class="question">
   How different is python from other programs like matlab and R?
   </div>
   <div class="answer"></p>
<p>All <em>programming languages</em> are fundamentally the same in many
   important ways.  The set of computations that can be expressed in all
   of these languages is exactly the same --- indeed, some define a
   programming language as a language that can express every possible
   computation.  One way to show this is that you could use Python to
   implement a Matlab simulator, or use Matlab to implement a Python
   simulator, or use Python to implement R, etc.  </p>
<p>At a pragmatic and superficial level though, programming languages
   can be quite different, and Matlab and R.  Matlab was designed to do
   numerical computation well, and R was designed for statistics, wheras
   Python was designed as a general-purpose programming language.  But,
   all of these languages have ways to do conditionals (<code>if</code> in Python),
   loops (<code>for</code> and <code>while</code> in Python), and to define and call
   procedures.  They also all have variables, but there are subtle
   differences in what they mean.  </p>
<p>But, they vary in expressiveness (how much code you would have to
   write to implement something), "truthiness" (how likely it is
   programs mean what the programmer intended), performance (how fast
   the program will run and how much memory and energy it uses), and
   style (what symbols are used to indicate function calls, whether or
   not whitespace matters (Python is quite unusual for not just ignoring
   whitespace), what kinds of names you can use, etc.).  The other big
   difference is what tools and libraries are available to make it
   easier to build programs in the language.  </p>
<p>There is a site, <a href="http://rosettacode.org/">RosettaCode.org</a>, that
   collects examples of code in different languages so you can compare
   how the same function would be defined in different programming
   languages.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/99_Bottles_of_Beer">one example</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Matlab:</strong></p>
<pre class="brush: python;">
function ninetyNineBottlesOfBeer()

    disp( [ sprintf(['%d bottles of beer on the wall, %d bottles of beer.\n'...
        'Take one down, pass it around...\n'],[(99:-1:2);(99:-1:2)])...
        sprintf(['1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.\nTake'...
        'one down, pass it around;\nNo more bottles of beer on the wall.']) ] );

    %The end of this song makes me sad. The shelf should always have more
    %beer...like college.

end
</pre>

<p><strong>R:</strong></p>
<pre class="brush: python;">
cat(paste(99:1,ifelse((99:1)!=1," bottles"," bottle"),
          " of beer on the wall\n",99:1,
          ifelse((99:1)!=1," bottles"," bottle")," of beer\n",
                 "Take one down, pass it around\n", 98:0,
                 ifelse((98:0)!=1, " bottles", " bottle"),
                 " of beer on the wall\n\n", sep=""), sep="")
</pre>

<p><strong>Python:</strong> (see <a href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/99_Bottles_of_Beer/Python">this page</a> for many different versions - this is either evidence of Python's popularity and expressiveness, or something more disturbing)</p>
<pre class="brush: python;">
for n in xrange(99, 0, -1):
    ##  The formatting performs a conditional check on the variable.
    ##  If it formats the first open for False, and the second for True
    print(n, 'bottle%s of beer on the the wall.' % ('s', '')[n == 1])
    print(n, 'bottle%s of beer.' % ('s', '')[n == 1])
    print('Take one down, pass it around.')
    print(n - 1, 'bottle%s of beer on the wall.\n' % ('s', '')[n - 1 == 1])
</pre>

</div>

<p><div class="question">
   I would like to know how to study for computer science and coding, because it seems like a very difficult topic. 
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
   I'll answer each of these separately, since I think the way to learn
   "computer science" is very different from the way to learn "coding".  </p>
<p><strong>Coding.</strong> By this, I mean being able to take a clear and precise
  description of a mechanical procedure and turn it into a program that
  executes correctly.  Coding is an important skill, and one can't
  develop as a computer scientist without being able to quickly and
  reliably turn procedures you understand into programs that can run.
  Learning coding is like learning to play a musical instrument, or to
  make basketball free throws.  It depends on reading and understanding
  how experts do it, and lots of practice.  The best way to get good at
  coding is to try to write a program at a level that is just beyond the
  last program you wrote, and then get advice from an experienced coder
  at how you could have done things better, and keep repeating this
  process.  As you get better, you should also be playing the role of
  the "experienced coder", looking at code written by others and
  advising them on how to make it better.  What we can do in class is a
  very poor substitute for this: you read code from experienced coders
  in class and in what we provide for the projects, and get some
  feedback on your own code from the assignments you subject; hopefully,
  you also get some of the more direct mentoring experience from your
  classmates and in office hours. </p>
<p><strong>Computer Science.</strong> Computer science is understanding how computers
  work and how to use them to solve problems.  It includes <em>programming</em>
  (the art of turning a possibly not well-defined problem into a precise
  procedure that solves that problem), as well as reasoning about the
  costs of executing that procedure and about the best possible
  procedures to solve some problem.  If learning coding is like learning
  to read music and play a musical instrument, learning computer science
  is more like learning to be a composer or songwriter.  It depends on
  studying the theoretical foundations and understanding them deeply, as
  well as by learning from the "great works" of the masters (in computer
  science, "great works" are often algorithms designed by people like
  Tony Hoare, Edsger Dijkstra, Leslie Lamport, and Donald Knuth;
  programming languages designed by people like John Backus, John
  McCarthy, Barbara Liskov, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and Niklaus
  Wirth).  But it also depends on trying to solve problems yourself, and
  gradually getting better at this by solving increasingly more
  challenging problems with less and less help (both from other people
  and resources).  </div></p>
<p><div class="question">
   What motivates you to be a professor/academic vs working in other jobs?
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
Being a professor is <a href="http://yourstory.com/2013/10/david-evans-udacity/">"the best job in the
world"</a>. You get to
do pretty much anything you want, work with interesting and ambitious
students, work with whomever you want, and spend most of your time
doing.  I've given a talk about this: <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/paradise/"><em>How to Live in Paradise: A Guide
for New and Disgruntled Professors</em></a>.</p>
<p>I haven't ever had what most people would consider a "real" job, but
have spent some time in big industry research labs and small to
medium-size startups.  This can be fun for a while, and there are some
advantages to such places (lots of high quality free food, more of an
opportunity to be part of a team with a shared mission, roller-coaster
of hyper-growth, and ability to have a direct impact on customers), but
nothing that compares to the paradasicalness of academia.
   </div></p>
<p><div class="question">
   Why do you think some students succeed at programming<sup>*</sup> vs others?
   </div>
   <div class="answer"></p>
<p><sup>*</sup> The original question used "coding" instead of
   "programming" (see the earlier question about for what I think the
   difference is), but I'm taking the liberty of changing this to
   "programming" (which is probably what the questioner meant, and
   consistent with common usage).</p>
<p>I firmly believe that no one <em>fails</em> at programming, only that some
   people give up before they would have succeeded.  So, the real
   question is "why do some people pick up programming quickly and
   (fairly) easily, whereas others find it frustrating and unpleasant?"  </p>
<p>I wish I knew the answer to this, but I don't (and I don't think
   anyone else has a great answer to it yet, either).  My best guess is
   that there are two things that make a huge difference:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Mental models: learning to program depends on being able to keep a
   clear model in your head about what is going on in a simulater
   computer.  Some people are able to do this more naturally than
   others, but I believe it is something everyone can learn. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How you deal with "adversity": people who are inclined to respond
   to failure (that is, things not doing what they expect or want) with
   frustration and despair, will tend to become frustrated and
   desparate.  Whereas people who respond to unexpected behavior with
   curiosity and wonder, will use that curiosity to learn new things.
   This is a personality trait to some degree, but it is also the result
   of past experiences.  People who have good experiences starting with
   failures and following their curiosity to learn how to solve problems
   on their own gain confidence that things do happen for good reasons
   and with effort it is possible to figure out why; people who start by
   having negative experiences where failures only lead to more failures
   and greater confusion tend to lose the ability and desire to explore
   curiously and thoughtfully, and get mired in frustration and mindless
   modification instead.
   </div></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><div class="question">
   How do I make sure I don't forget what I learn in this course?
   </div>
   <div class="answer"></p>
<p>Its not about forgetting or remembering, its about being empowered by
   what you learn in this course to go on to do things you wouldn't do
   otherwise.  </p>
<p>My hope is you will end up doing things long into the future that build
   upon what you've learned in this class.  Even if you've forgotten
   almost everything you've learned, hopefully you'll have replaced it
   with better and more powerful knowledge that you've learned as a
   result!</p>
