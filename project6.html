<h1>Project 6: Charming Snakes with Mesmerizing Memoizers</h1>
<div class="turnin">

<p><strong>Deliverables:</strong> For this assignment, there is no paper turn-in required for this problem set.  All of your answers should be clearly marked in the <code>charme.py</code> file you modify and submit electronically by email to <em>evans@virginia.edu</em>.
To be eligible for the first Red Belt test opportunity, you should complete Project 6 by <strong>Friday, 22 April</strong>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Understand how language interpreters work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gain experience with a programming language quite different from Python.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand the meta-circular evaluator</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ruminate on the nature of universal programming languages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn how changing the evaluation rules changes programming and running time</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Collaboration Policy</h4>
<p>For this assignment, you may <em>work alone</em> or <em>work with a partner</em>. </p>
<p><strong>If you work with a partner, you and your partner should submit a
single assignment with both of your names and UVA ids on it.</strong> You and
your partner should work on all the problems together, and both of you
must completely understand everything you turn in.  You should also take
turns driving (typing) when you are at the computer.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you work alone or with a partner, you may discuss
the assignment with anyone you want and get help from others, so long as
it is help in the spirit of learning how to do things yourself not
getting answers you don't understand.  You should understand everything
you turn in for the assignment well enough to be able to produce it
completely on your own.</p>
<p>Remember to follow the <a href="pledge.html">course pledge</a> you read and signed at
the beginning of the semester.  For this assignment, you may consult any
outside resources, including books, papers, web sites and people, you
wish <i>except</i> for materials from previous cs1120 courses or direct
solutions to the given problems.  You may consult anyone you want, but
that person cannot type anything in for you and all work must remain
your own and outside sources should never give you specific answers to
problem set questions.</p>
<p>If you use resources other than the class materials, lectures and course
staff, you should document this in your turn-in.</p>
<p>You are <strong>strongly encouraged</strong> to take advantage of the scheduled
 help hours and office hours for this course.</p>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Languages are powerful tools for thinking.  One way to solve problems is
to think of a language in which a solution to the problem can be easily
expressed, and then to implement that language.  This is the <em>"great Hop
forward"</em> that Grace Hopper made in the 1950s: we can produce programs
that implement languages.  The input to the program is an expression
specification in some language.  If the program is an interpreter, the
result is the value of that expression.</p>
<p>In this problem set, we provide a working interpreter for the Charme
language, which is approximately a subset of Scheme.  Scheme is a simple
programming language (which you've encountered some in the coursebook)
that is designed to support a functional style of programming where
programs are built by composing functions.</p>
<p>The interpreter implements the Scheme evaluation rules with state. Your
assignment involves understanding the interpreter and making some
additions and changes to it.  </p>
<p>If you are successful, you will produce an interpreter for the language
<em>Mesmerize</em> in which the original Fibonacci procedure that includes two
recursive calls will have running time that is approximately linear in
the <em>value</em> of its input (compared to the exponential time it would have
with a normal Scheme interpreter), and the simple edit distance
procedure from <a href="project2.html">Project 2</a> runs fast enough for reasonably
large inputs (analyzing its actual running time is left as a bonus
problem).</p>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p>Read <a href="http://www.computingbook.org/Interpreters.pdf">Chapter 11:
Interpreters</a> of the course book.  The starting code for this project
is explained in Chapter 11.</p>
<h3>Project 6 Repository</h3>
<p>Set up your project6 repository in the same way as you did for previous
projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Fork Project 6.</strong> Visit
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/cs1120/project6/fork">https://bitbucket.org/cs1120/project6/fork</a>.
Make sure to check the "This is a private repository" box to make your
forked repository private (only visible to yourself and people you
authorize to access it).  If you are working with a partner, just one of
you should fork the repository.  Then, add the other partner's bitbucket
id to have access to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clone to your machine.</strong> To have a working copy of the repository on
your machine, clone the forked repository in SourceTree by
selecting <code>File | New/Clone</code> and enter the URL of the cloned
repository. You can copy this from the project page you see in
bitbucket.org afer forking the provided Project 5 repository.  It should
be a URL like <code>https://&lt;your bitbucket id&gt;@bitbucket.org/&lt;your bitbucket
id&gt;/project6.git</code>.  If you are working with a partner, <em>both</em> partners
should clone the forked repository, so you each have a local copy of it.
(For this project, you should work together when you work on the code.
In general, though, using git allows many people to work on the same
code and share their changes, and handle conflicts when two people edit
the same file.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The project6 repository contains just one file: <code>charme.py</code>.  </p>
<p><div class="warning">
For the questions in this assignment, you will modify <em>charme.py</em> which you will submit electronically when you are
finished. Please <b>mark clearly (using comments)</b> the 
changes you have made for Problems 3 - 8.
   </div></p>
<h3>Getting Started With Charme</h3>
<p>Open <code>charme.py</code> and select <tt>Run | Run Module</tt> (F5) to load the
definitions into the interpreter.  This file contains all the code from
Chapter 11 of the course book, with some modifications to make it work
in Python 3 (the code provided in the book is for Python 2).</p>
<p>It defines a procedure <code>meval</code> that takes two inputs: a list that
represents a Charme expression and an environment.  It outputs the value
of the input expression.  </p>
<p>The <code>initializeGlobalEnvironment()</code> procedure initializes the global
environment in the global variable <code>globalEnvironment</code>.  We can use the
as the second input to <code>meval</code>.</p>
<p>You can try some evaluations using <code>meval</code> directly: </p>
<pre class="brush: python;">
>>> initializeGlobalEnvironment()
>>> meval('23', globalEnvironment)
23
>>> meval(['+', '1', '2'], globalEnvironment)
3
</pre>

<!--python-->

<p>This is a bit awkward since the first input is not in the standard
Charme notation, but is the data structure that results from parsing
<code>"(+ 1 2)"</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>parse</code> function takes a string representing one or more Charme
expressions and returns a list containing each input expression as a
structured list. For example:</p>
<pre class="brush: python;">
>>> parse("23")
['23']
>>> parse("(+ 1 2 (* 3 4))")
[['+', '1', '2', ['*', '3', '4']]]
>>> parse("(define square (lambda (x) (* x x)))")
[['define', 'square', ['lambda', ['x'], ['*', 'x', 'x']]]]
</pre>

<!--python-->

<p>Since <code>parse</code> takes one or more expressions and produces a list of
expressions as its output, we cannot pass the result from <code>parse</code>
directly to <code>meval</code>.  If we just parse one expression, we just want to
pass the first element of the <code>parse</code> output to <code>meval</code>:</p>
<pre class="brush: python;">
>>> meval(parse("(+ 1 2 (* 3 4))")[0], globalEnvironment)
15
</pre>

<!--python-->

<p>It is a bit awkward to remember the <code>[0]</code> and to pass in the
<code>globalEnvironment</code>, so we have defined a function
<code>evalInGlobal(_expr_)</code> that takes a string representing a single Charme
expression and evaluates it in the <code>globalEnvironment</code>:</p>
<pre class="brush: python;">
def evalInGlobal(expr):
    return meval(parse(expr)[0], globalEnvironment)
</pre>

<!--python-->

<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="brush: python;">
>>> initializeGlobalEnvironment()
>>> evalInGlobal("(define square (lambda (x) (* x x)))")
>>> evalInGlobal("(square 4)")
16
>>> evalInGlobal("square")
<__main__.Procedure instance at 0x03C0BE18>
</pre>

<!--python-->

<p>(Of course, the actual address in memory where your procedure is stored
will vary).</p>
<p>We have also provided the <code>evalLoop()</code> function that provides an
interactions buffer for Charme, similar to the Python shell.</p>
<p>From the perspective of our shiny new interpreter, a Charme program is
just a string that we parse and evaluate.</p>
<p><div class="q">
<strong>Problem 1.</strong> Define a factorial procedure in Charme. Express your
procedure as <em>string</em> in Python by defining a variable called
<code>charme_factorial</code>.  When you evaluate <code>evalInGlobal(charme_factorial)</code>,
it should define a Charme procedure called <code>factorial</code>.<br />
   </div></p>
<p>When you've complete Problem 1 correctly, you should see output like this: </p>
<pre class="brush: python;">
>>> initializeGlobalEnvironment()
>>> evalInGlobal(charme_factorial)
>>> evalInGlobal("(factorial 5)")
120
</pre>

<!--python-->

<h2>Adding Primitives</h2>
<p>The set of primitives provided by our Charme interpreter is
<em>sufficient</em>, in that it is enough to express every computation.  (One
way to prove this would be to implement a Turing Machine simulator in
Charme.)  However, it is not enough to express every computation in a
convenient way.</p>
<p><div class="q">
<strong>Problem 2.</strong> Extend the Charme interpreter by adding a primitive
procedure <code>&lt;=</code> (less than or equal to) to the global environment.  You
will need to define a procedure that implements the primitive, and
modify <code>initializeGlobalEnvironment</code> to install your primitive.
   </div></p>
<p>It should behave like this:</p>
<pre class="brush: python;">
>>> initializeGlobalEnvironment()
>>> evalInGlobal("(<= 5 3)") 
False 
>>> evalInGlobal("(<= 3 7)") 
True
</pre>

<!--python-->

<p>Our Charme interpreter does not provide any primitives for lists.  As we
saw in <a href="class11.html">Class 11</a>, it is possible to define everything you
need to make pairs and then lists just using procedures that are already
provided by Charme.</p>
<p>However, it would be more convenient if some primitives for
manipulating pairs are provided.  </p>
<p><div class="q">
<strong>Problem 3.</strong> Extend the Charme interpreter by adding primitive
functions <code>cons</code> (this is the Scheme name for <code>make_pair</code>), <code>car</code> (the Scheme name for <code>pair_first</code>) and <code>cdr</code> (the Scheme name for <code>pair_last</code>) that behave similarly to the primitive Scheme procedures.  (Read on for some hints.)
   </div></p>
<p>You should start by defining a <code>class</code> that represents a cons cell (a
pair).  For example, you might define a <code>Pair</code> class that has an
<code>__init__</code> method that takes two inputs (the first and second parts of
the pair), and provides methods for <code>get_first</code> and <code>get_last</code> that
retrieve the respective parts of the <code>Pair</code> object.</p>
<p>You must also define a <code>__str__(self)</code> method for your class so that
<code>evalLoop</code> and <code>evalToplevelExp</code> will print out your Pair objects in a readable way.</p>
<p>You should get the following interactions in the <code>evalLoop()</code>:</p>
<pre class="brush: python;">
Charme> (cons 1 2)
(1 . 2)
Charme> (car (cons 1 2))
1
Charme> (cdr (cons 1 2))
2
Charme> quit
</pre>

<!--python-->

<p><div class="q">
<strong>Problem 4.</strong> Extend the Charme interpreter by defining the <code>null</code> and
<code>null?</code> primitives.  (Note that unlike in Charme, names in Python cannot
include question marks, so you will have to use a different name for the
Python procedure you use to implement <code>null?</code>.)  (<strong>Hint:</strong> You could use Python's <code>None</code> value to represent <code>null</code>.)
   </div></p>
<p><div class="q">
<strong>Problem 5.</strong> Extend the Charme interpreter by defining the <code>list</code>
primitive procedure.  Like the Scheme <code>list</code> primitive procedure, it
should take any number of operands and produce as output a list containing
each operand as an element in order.
   </div></p>
<p>After finishing these questions, you should get the following
interactions in the <code>evalLoop()</code>:</p>
<pre class="brush: python;">
Charme> (define a (list 1 2 3 4))
Charme> (car a)
1
Charme> (null? a)
False
Charme> (null? (list ))
True
Charme> (cdr (cdr a))
(3 4)
</pre>

<!--python-->

<p><div class="indented">
Note that the last output is the way Scheme prints lists, and you are
encouraged to make your Charme interpreter also print out lists this
way.  It is acceptable, though, to print out lists in a more
straightforward way, so they would be displayed as normal cons pairs.
Then, this would look like, <code>(3 . (4 . None))</code>, instead.
   </div></p>
<h2>Special Forms</h2>
<p>The provided Charme interpreter does not include the <code>cond</code> special
form.  Before attempting to answer the next question, we recommend
carefully understanding the evaluation rule for the conditional
expression (as described in Section 10.1.2 of the coursebook).</p>
<p><div class="q">
<strong>Problem 6.</strong> Extend the Charme interpreter to support the <code>cond</code>
special form, with the same meaning as the Scheme cond expression.
(Your Charme cond expression does not need to support the
special <code>else</code> syntax supported by Scheme.)
   </div></p>
<p>After adding <code>cond</code> to your Charme interpreter, you should get the
following interactions using <code>evalLoop()</code>:</p>
<pre class="brush: python;">
Charme> (cond)
None
Charme> (cond ((> 1 2) 2))
None
Charme> (cond ((> 1 2) 2) ((> 3 2) 3))
3
Charme> (define fibo (lambda (n) (cond ((= n 1) 1) ((= n 2) 1) (true
(+ (fibo (- n 1)) (fibo (- n 2)))))))
None
Charme> (fibo 10)
55
</pre>

<!--python-->

<h2>Memoizing</h2>
<p>Memoizing is a technique for improving efficiency by storing and reusing
the results of previous procedure applications.  If a procedure has no
side effects and uses no global variables, everytime it is evaluated on
the same operands it produces the same result.  You should remember
memoizing from <a href="project2.html">Project 2</a>.</p>
<p>To implement memoizing, we need to save the results of all function
applications in a table.  When a function application is evaluated,
first, we lookup the application in the table to see if it has already
been computed.  If there is a known value, that is the result of the
evaluation and no further computation need be done.  If there is not,
then the function application is evaluated, the result is stored in the
table, and the result is returned as the value.</p>
<p><div class="q">
<strong>Problem 7.</strong> Modify the Charme interpreter to support memoizing for all
function applications.  (<strong>Hint:</strong> Python dictionaries will be very useful for this!)
   </div></p>
<p>Once you have modified the interpreter, you should be able to evaluate
<code>(fibo 60)</code> without changing the definition of <code>fibo</code> above.  By
changing the meaning of the application evaluation rule, a procedure
that previously had running time exponential in the value of the input,
now has running time that is linear in the value of the input!</p>
<p><div class="q">
<strong>Problem 8. (Bonus)</strong> [This question is a "bonus question".  It is not
necessary to answer this to pass Project 6, but an exemplary answer to
this question, along with completion of Problems 1-8 from <a href="project5.html">Project
5</a>, will be justification for automatic promotion to Red
Belt.]</p>
<p><b>a.</b> Define a Charme procedure that implements the edit distance
function from <a href="project2.html">Project 2</a>.</p>
<p><b>b.</b> Analyze the running time of your procedure, using the memoized
Charme interpreter.</p>
<p><b>c.</b> Analyze the running time of your procedure, using the standard
Charme interpreter (without memoization)
   </div></p>
<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<p><strong>Reminder:</strong> For this assignment, there is no paper turn-in required for
this problem set.  All of your answers should be clearly marked in the
<code>charme.py</code> file you modify and submit electronically by email to
<em>evans@virginia.edu</em>.  To be eligible for the first Red Belt test
opportunity, you should complete Project 6 by <strong>Friday, 22 April</strong>.</p></div>
