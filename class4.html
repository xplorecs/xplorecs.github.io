<h3>White Belt Advancement</h3>
<p>If you have not yet passed the white belt exam, here's what you should
do:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For each question you did not answer well on the original exam write
  up a good, correct solution to that question, as well as a brief
  explanation of why your previous answer was wrong (when possible this
  shouldn't just be about why it was incorrect, but what was confused in
  your understanding that led to the incorrect answer or inability to
  answer the question).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Answer the following additional question:
  <div class="indented">
  Describe the set of strings produced by the BNF grammar below starting from <em>S</em> (you can use clear English to write your description, or mathematical set notation).
  <div class="bnf">
  <em>S</em> ::= <em>S</em> <em>S</em><br />
<em>S</em> ::= <em>T</em><br />
<em>T</em> ::= <strong>0</strong><br />
<em>T</em> ::= <strong>1</strong><br />
  </div>
  </div></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attach your writeup (including your answer to question 6 above) to the
  graded exam, and turn it in at Monday's class (or drop it off at my
  office before then).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You are allowed to discuss the questions and answers with anyone you
want (including other students in the class), but must write your
solutions and explanations yourself and completely understand everything
in them.</p>
<p>Doing this well will be sufficient to earn the White Belt.  Students who
do not complete the White Belt exam this way, will have a final
opportunity to do it via an oral exam during office hours or scheduled
at another time.</p>
<p>It is necessary to complete the White Belt before advancing to the
Yellow Belt.</p>
<h3>Yellow Belt Requirements</h3>
<p>To earn the Yellow Belt, you are expected to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Complete Udacity cs101 <em>Lesson 2: How to Repeat</em> and <em>Lesson 2: Problem Set</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read the coursebook through the end of <a href="//computingbook.org/Programming.pdf">Section
  3.2</a>.  You are not expected
  to read the rest of Chapter 3 (which uses a different programming
  language, Scheme, from the Python language we are using now).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Successfully complete <a href="project1.html">Project 1</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Project 1 is due on <strong>Friday, 5 February</strong> (that's one week from
today!).  Students who turn in exemplary Project 1 assignments will earn
their Yellow Belt based on those; others will have an opportunity to
earn the Yellow Belt by taking an exam the following week (more details
on that upcoming).  Completing a satisfactory Project 1 is a
precondition for being able to take the Yellow Belt exam (that is, you
can't take the exam to advance to the Yellow Belt until after you have
submitted a satisfactory Project 1).</p>

<h3>Slacking</h3>
<p>If you are still using a username like <code>mst3k</code> in slack, please visit
<a href="https://cs1120.slack.com/account/settings">https://cs1120.slack.com/account/settings</a>,
click the "Expand" button on the right side of the "Username" field, and
enter a more pronouncable username for yourself.  It doesn't need to be
your real name, but something more pleasant than your UVA ID.</p>
<p>Please post questions here &mdash; I will assume everyone understands
everything in the readings and cs101 lessons unless there are questions
about them.  Its okay if you don't know how to formulate a good question
- its enough to just say something like, "I'm confused about procedural
abstraction", or to reply to someone else posting this with "me too!",
so we know topics that it would be worthwhile to cover in class.  (If
you can state a clear question, of course, that's better, and someone
may be able to answer it usefully.)</p>
<h2>Notes and Questions</h2>
<p>Given that a general-purpose computer can run any program (given enough
time and memory), why does your smartphone have more than one of them?</p>
<div class="biggap"></div>

<p><strong>Challenge Question.</strong> How does the computing power in each one of the
  120 cores of your smartphone's graphics processing unit compare to the
  computing power NASA used in 1969 to go to the moon?  (We didn't
  answer this in class, but a good answer, worthy of presenting to the
  class, would be worth an automatic belt promotion.)</p>
<div class="biggap"></div>

<p>What is an efficient way to hand back papers to a class?</p>
<div class="biggap"></div></div>
