<h1>Course Pledge</h1>
<div class="printing"><a href="static/docs/pledge.pdf">PDF for Printing</a></div>

<p>As a student at Mr. Jefferson's University, you are trusted to be honorable.</p>
<p>We take advantage of this trust to provide a better learning environment
for everyone. In particular, students in cs1120 are expected to follow
these rules throughout the course:</p>
<p><strong>I will not lie, cheat or steal.</strong> If I am unsure whether something
  would be considered lying, cheating or stealing, I will ask before
  doing it.</p>
<p><strong>I will carefully read and follow the collaboration policy on each
  assignment.</strong> I will not abuse resources in ways that would be clearly
  detrimental to my own learning or unfair to other students.</p>
<h2>Other Expectations</h2>
<p>In addition to the honor rules, students in cs1120 are also expected to
follow these behaviors:</p>
<p><strong>I will be open minded and curious.</strong> I understand that this course
  adopts a different approach than other introductory computing courses
  offered at the University, and may buck many of the conventions
  followed by typical courses.  I will ask questions when things make me
  uncomfortable, but also accept that being surprised, facing
  uncertainty and adversity, and being challenged unreasonably are often
  necessary for learning new ways of thinking.</p>
<p><strong>I will do what I can to help my fellow classmates learn.</strong> Except when
specifically instructed not to, this means when other students ask me
for help, I will attempt to provide it. I will look at their answers and
discuss what I think is good or bad about their answers. I will help
others improve their work, but will not give them my answers directly. I
will try to teach them what they need to know to discover solutions
themselves.</p>
<p><strong>I will ask for help.</strong> I will make a reasonable effort to do things on
  my own first (or with my partners for group assignment), but will ask
  my classmates or the course staff for help before getting overly
  frustrated. There are many ways to ask for help including the course
  website, slack group, and office hours.</p>
<p><strong>I grant the course staff permission to reproduce and distribute
excerpts from my submissions for teaching purposes.</strong> If may opt-out of
this by adding a comment to your code, but without an explicit opt-out
comment we assume you agree to it.  My work will be attributed when it
is shown in a postive way, but may be used anonymously if it is used to
illustrate common pitfalls or other issues.</p>
<p><strong>I will provide useful feedback.</strong> I realize that this is a new and
experimental course, and it is important that I let the course staff
know what they need to improve the course. I will not wait until the end
of the course to make the course staff aware of any problems. I will
provide feedback either anonymously or by contacting the course staff
directly.  <strong>I will fill out all requested surveys honestly and
thoroughly.</strong></p></div>
