<h1>Green Belt Promotion</h1>
<p>If you received a Gold Star (Yellow Smiley) or better on <a href="project3.html">Project
3</a>, you have earned your Green Belt!</p>
<p>If not, here's what to do to get promoted:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Complete <a href="project3.html">Project 3</a>.  You can work with anyone you want
to do this, and get help from students who have already completed it,
but you must understand everything you turn in for this yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solve the additional problem G1 below:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><div class="q"> 
<strong>Problem G1:</strong> Define a function <code>higher_curve</code> that takes as input two
curves (represented by functions that return points, as in Project 3)
and returns a new curve that combines the two input curves in a way that
always selects the highest (greatest y-coordinate) of the two points
that would be produced for a given <code>t</code> value.
   </div></p>
<p>You can submit your answer by email (to <a href="mailto:evans@virginia.edu"><em>evans@virginia.edu</em></a>) with subject
line <code>Green Belt Promotion</code>, and attached a Python file with all your
code (this can be your completed <code>project3.py</code> file, with the additional
<code>higher_curve</code> function, but it should be clear and easy for me to see
the code you wrote for these problems).</p>
<p>This promotion opportunity is valid until Saturday, March 5, after which
additional problems may be added.</p></div>
