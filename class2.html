<h3>White Belt Exam</h3>
<p>Because of the snow day, the first opportunity to pass the white belt
test will be in class this <strong>Wednesday, 27 January</strong>.  The test will be
a short, in-class, on-paper test that includes some short answer
questions and a few questions where you have to understand and write
short Python code snippets.  The questions will cover these materials:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything covered in <a href="class1.html">Class 1</a> and <a href="class2.html">Class 2</a> (today).</li>
<li><a href="http://computingbook.org/Computing.pdf">Chapter 1</a> and <a href="http://computingbook.org/Language.pdf">Chapter 2</a> of the coursebook.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101">Udacity cs101</a> Lesson 1 and
  Lesson 1: Problem Set.</li>
<li>The <a href="pledge.html">Course Pledge</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have done and understand all of these before class Wednesday, you
should be able to earn your white belt and be able to start working on
your yellow belt.  Please take advantage of the upcoming scheduled
office hours (Tuesday at 3:30, Rice 507), ask questions in the Slack
group, and all the on-line resources.  If you don't pass the white belt
test Wednesday, there will be later opportunities to pass it in
different ways (which could involve an oral exam during office hours).</p>

<h2>Notes and Questions</h2>
<p>What is Computer Science? 
<div class="gap"></div></p>
<p>What is a language?
<div class="gap"></div></p>
<p>Languages are made of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primitives</strong> (almost<sup><em></sup> all languages have these) &#8211; the simplest surface forms with meaning (</em> surprisingly it is possible to make a powerful language without any primitives.  We will see one before the end of this class!)</li>
<li><strong>Means of Combination</strong> (all languages have these) &#8211; rules of production (ways to make new surface forms from ones you already have)</li>
<li><strong>Means of Abstraction</strong> (all powerful languages have these) &#8211; ways to use simple surface forms to represent complicated ones</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Backus-Naur Form</strong> (BNF): A way of describing the surface forms in a language using replacement rules in the form:</p>
<p><div class="bnf">
<em>non-terminal</em> <tt>::=</tt> <em>replacement</em>
   </div></p>
<p>The rule means whenever you have what is on the left side of the
<tt>::=</tt>, you can replace it with what is on the right side.</p>
<p>What strings can the following BNF grammar produce?</p>
<p><div class="bnf">
<em>Sentence</em> ::= <em>Food Comparator Food</em><br />
<em>Food</em> ::= <strong>Bodo&#8217;s Bagels</strong><br />
<em>Food</em> ::= <strong>Einstein’s Bagels</strong><br />
<em>Comparator</em> ::= <strong>are better than</strong><br />
<em>Comparator</em> ::= <strong>are worse than</strong><br />
   </div>
<div class="gap"></div></p>
<p>What strings can the following BNF grammar produce?</p>
<p><div class="bnf">
<em>Sentence</em> ::= <strong>I like</strong> <em>FoodList</em><br />
<em>FoodList</em> ::= <em>Food</em><br />
<em>FoodList</em> ::= <em>Food</em> <strong>and</strong> <em>FoodList</em><br />
<em>Food</em> ::= <strong>Bodo’s Bagels</strong><br />
<em>Food</em> ::= <strong>Einstein’s Bagels</strong><br />
   </div>
<div class="gap"></div></p>
<p>When learning a new language, which of <em>primitives</em>, <em>means of
combination</em>, or <em>means of abstraction</em> is hardest to learn?</p>
<div class="spacer"></div>

<p>Are there any non-recursive natural languages?
<div class="spacer"></div></p>
<p>What would happen to a society that spoke one?
<div class="spacer"></div></p>

(This is a file that can be processed automatically by a a program to
read Python programs, so it is a bit hard to read.  But, it is
essentially the same BNF notation we have seen in class and the book.)</p>
<p>The sentence, "Nine and a half turtles wearing orange aprons with
watermelons on them began to simultaneously yodel as the conductor
stepped on the kitchen table." is from the article <a href="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~ycharles/sign708.pdf"><em>Who’s afraid of

<p><div class="quote">
Computers are actually pretty simple.  We&#8217;re sitting here on a
bench in this cafe.  Let’s assume that you understood only the most
rudimentary of directions and you asked how to find the rest room.  I
would have to describe it to you in very specific and precise
instructions.  I might say, &#8220;Scoot sideways two meters off the
bench.  Stand erect.  Life left foot.  Bend left knee until it is
horizontal.  Extend left foot and shift weight 300 centimeters
forward.&#8221; and on and on.  If you could interpret all those
instructions 100 times faster than any other person in this cafe, you
would appear to be a magician: You could run over and grab a milk shake
and bring it back and set it on the table and snap your fingers, and I’d
think you make the milkshake appear, because it was so fast relative to
my perception.  That’s exactly what a computer does.  It takes these
very, very simple-minded instructions – &#8220;Go fetch a number, add it
to this number, put the result there, perceive if it’s greater than this
other number&#8221; – but executes them at a rate of, let&#8217;s say,
1,000,000 per second.  At 1,000,000 per second, the results appear to be
magic.  That&#8217;s a simple explanation, and the point is that people
really don’t have to understand how computers work.  </p></p>
