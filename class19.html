<h1>Class 19 - Notes</h1>
<h3>Upcoming Schedule</h3>
<p><a href="project4.html">Project 4</a> is due Wednesday, 16 March.  </p>
<p><strong>To be eligible to take the Blue Belt test on Monday, 21 March</strong>, you
must have (1) completed the Green Belt, and (2) submitted a satisfactory
Project 4.  (If you are not eligible to take the first Blue Belt test
opportunity, you will have more opportunities for Blue Belt promotion
later.)</p>
<p>The Blue Belt test will be during the class period on Monday, 21 March.
Students who are not eligible to take the Blue Belt test will have a
review class and help opportunity in a different location.  (We'll
figure out the locations after determining how many students are ready
to take the Blue Best test.)  </p>
<p>To pass the Blue Belt level you should demonstrate:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ability to write and reason about functions that use conditional and
  looping statements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to write and reason about functions that are defined
  recursively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand the list data type, and how to write and reason about
  functions that operator on lists (including lists of lists, and deeply
  nested lists).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to analyze the cost of a function and basic understanding of
  how computing machines work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Being promoted to a Blue Belt ensures at least a B- as the final grade
in the course (with exceptions for extreme cases of misbehaior such as
not attempting to do anything else for the rest of the semester or
cheating).</p>

<h1>Cost of Computing</h1>
<p>To reason about the cost of executing a program, we need to have a model
of computation that makes it clear what we are actually measuring.
Later in the class we'll look at the Turing machine model which provides
a very precise and clear model of computation where each step is well
defined and we can measure cost of computation as the number of steps to
complete execution.  </p>
<p>With Python code, we'll settle for a simpler, more intuitive model, that
corresponds fairly closely (but not exactly) to the cost of running a
program in the Python interpreter.  </p>
<p>The assumption is that <em>each individual statement or expression
evaluation takes constant time</em>.  This does not include the time for any
functions called inside an evaluation.  So, we assume these operations
are constant time (that is, we could count each of these as one unit of
cost, and that cost does not scale with the size of the inputs or length
of program):</p>
<p><strong>Assignment statements.</strong> The cost of <code>a = expression</code> is just the cost
  of evaluating the expression plus a small constant for moving the
  value into the location of <code>a</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Arithmetic and comparison operations on bounded values.</strong> If at least
  one of the inputs to an operator (e.g., <code>+</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>==</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, etc.)
  has a bounded value (is known to be less than some fixed value), the
  cost of computing the operation is constant.</p>
<p><strong>List indexing and slicing.</strong> We will assume the cost of all list
  operations is constant.  This is most definitely <em>not</em> true, but
  estimating an accurate cost gets into how the underlying list
  abstraction is implemented.  We'll keep things simple by assuming the
  cost of both indexing (<code>a[i]</code>) is constant (this is probably nearly
  true), and slicing (<code>a[1:]</code>) is also constant (this is false in
  reality, but there are ways to implement lists that would make it
  true).</p>
<p><strong>Calling and returning from functions.</strong> The cost to call a function or
  return from a function is constant.  Note that this does not include
  the cost of actually executing the function, just the cost of calling it.</p>
<p><strong>Control flow.</strong> The cost of an <code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, or <code>for</code> statement is
  the cost of executing its components (and only constant additional
  cost).  </p>
<p>From these assumptions, we can reason about the cost of any Python
program (at least those you'll see at this point of the course;
additional assumptions may be needed for some later programs).</p>
<h3>Loops</h3>
<p>The cost of executing a loop is the average cost of each iteration times
the number of iterations.  For example,</p>
<pre class="brush: python;">
sum = 0
for i in range(n):
   sum = sum + 1
</pre>

<!--python-->

<p>The loop executes <code>n</code> times, and each iteration does a constant amount
of work (the <code>+</code> operation, where the value of one of the inputs is
bounded).  So, the total work of the loop is in &Theta;(<em>n</em>) where <em>n</em>
is the value of <code>n</code>.</p>
<!--page-->

<h3>Nested Loops</h3>
<pre class="brush: python;">
sum = 0
for i in range(n):
   for j in range(n):
       sum = sum + 1
   sum = sum * 2
</pre>

<!--python-->

<p>Here, the outer loop executes <code>n</code> times, so we need to figure out the
cost of each iteration.  Its body includes a constant time <code>*</code>
operation, but also a loop that executes <code>n</code> time.  The cost of the <code>for
j in range(n): sum = sum + 1</code> loop is in <span class="math">&Theta;(<em>n</em>)</span> where <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> is the
value of <code>n</code>, since it executes <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> iterations, each of which does
constant work.  Hence, the total cost is <span class="math"><em>n</em> * &Theta;(<em>n</em>)</span> since there
are <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> iterations of the <code>i</code> loop, each of which has cost in
<span class="math">&Theta;(<em>n</em>)</span>.  This simplifies to a total cost for the loop in
<span class="math">&Theta;(<em>n</em><sup>2</sup>)</span>.</p>
<h3>Recursive Functions</h3>
<p>Analyzing the cost of a recusive function is similar to a loop: we need
to figure out the cost of each function execution, and multiply that by
the number of executions.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre class="brush: python;">
def sum_list(lst):
   if len(lst) == 0:
       return 0
   else:
       return lst[0] + sum_list(lst[1:])
</pre>

<!--python-->

<p>Recall our assumption that the list indexing and slicing operations have
constant time, and assuming all of the elements in the list have bounded
values, so does the <code>+</code> operation.  Hence, the cost of executing the
function body (not counting the recursive call) is constant: <span class="math"><em>O</em>(1)</span>.</p>
<p>The number of recursive calls is the number of elements in the list:
each call shortens the length of the input list by one element, so we
need <code>len(lst)</code> calls to reach the base case.  </p>
<p>Hence, there are <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> executions of a constant-time function body, so the
total cost is in <span class="math"><em>n</em> * <em>O</em>(1)</span> which simplifes to <span class="math">Theta;(<em>n</em>)</span> where <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> is
the length of the input <code>lst</code>.</p></div>
