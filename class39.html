<h1>Class 39 - Where to Go From Here</h1>
<p><div class="printing"><a href="static/docs/class39.pdf">PDF for Printing</a></div></p>
<h2>Schedule</h2>
<p>You have until <strong>11:59pm tonight</strong> to submit materials for qualifying
for a new belt exam (unless you have already arranged for more time with
me).</p>
<p>I will have my last scheduled office hours on <strong>Tuesday (May 3),
3:30-4:30pm</strong>.  After that, I will have meetings by appointment, but I
will be traveling May 5 through May 16, so not able to meet in person or
accept any paper drop-off assignments during this time.  To submit your
work after May 3, you should send a PDF file that is a readable scan of
your work.  Please check the PDF is readable before sending it.</p>
<h2>Course Feedback</h2>
<p>On the <a href="pledge.html">course pledge</a> you signed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I will provide useful feedback.</strong> I realize that this is a new and
experimental course, and it is important that I let the course staff
know what they need to improve the course. I will not wait until the end
of the course to make the course staff aware of any problems. I will
provide feedback either anonymously or by contacting the course staff
directly.  <strong>I will fill out all requested surveys honestly and
thoroughly.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please honor this.  </p>
<p>In addition to the University's course survey, I have <a href="finalsurvey.html"><strong>my own
survey</strong></a>
<a href="http://xplorecs/finalsurvey">(http://xplorecs/finalsurvey)</a> that
focuses on things I especially want feedback on in designing future
courses.  As an added incentive to do the survey, after submitting it
you will receive the "magic words".</p>
<p>I am particularly interested in feedback on "tae kwon do" grading.  The
grading system used in this class was designed to emphasize learning,
reduce student stress, and provide sufficient motivation for students to
succeed in the class.  I am not sure if it did this successfully, and I
think there was a lot of confusion about how it worked.  I would much
appreciate your thoughts on this, and any ideas you have for how this
might or might not work in a larger class.</p>
<h2>Where to Go From Here</h2>
<p>If you'd like to see a summary of the main themes in the course, and
some interviews with UVA alumni CS graduate students at Berkeley, watch
Lesson 7 of the cs101 course.</p>
<p>If you would like to go into more depth on theoretical computer science
and its mathematical foundations, take <em>cs2102: Discrete Math</em>.  If you
want to take another class from me, I'm teaching one of the sections of
cs2102 in the Fall (the one listed now as "Staff", Tuesday/Thursday at
11am).  If not, you should take David Edwards' section (Tuesday/Thursday
at 2pm).</p>
<p>If you are stressed out during finals week, I recommend borrowing a
three-year-old and going to <a href="http://jumpcville.com/">Jump</a>.  If you
can't find a three-year-old to borrow, just pretend to be one yourself.</p>
<p>If you like taking on-line courses and want to build on what you've
learned in this class to learn how to make scalable, interactive web
applications, you should take Steve Huffman's <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/web-development--cs253">Web Development: How to
Build a Blog</a>
course.  </p>
<p>If you like taking on-line courses and want to get more deeply into how
interpreters work and more advanced ways of using Python, you should
take Westley Weimer's <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-languages--cs262">Programming Languages: Building a Web
Browser</a>
course.</p>
<p>If you are interested in research in computer security or you have your
own idea for and interesting project, talk to me about opportunities in
my research group (see
<a href="https://www.jeffersonswheel.org/">https://www.jeffersonswheel.org</a>).  I
also have funding to support students working on developing educational
materials targeted to high school students over the summer.</p>
<p>If you would like to understand better how music, art, and logic use
recursive definitions, read Douglas Hofstadter’s fascinating and
compelling book, <a href="www.amazon.com/G%c3%b6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567.html"><em>Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden
Braid</em></a>.
If you prefer comic books, try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logicomix-search-truth-Apostolos-Doxiadis/dp/1596914521/"><em>Logicomix: An Epic Search for
Truth</em></a> by Apostolos Doxiadis and Christos Papadimitriou.  </p>
<p>If you would like more personal advice on what to do next, feel free to
contact me.  I'm always happy to take any cs1120 graduates out for lunch
or coffee to hear about what you're doing, and offer any advice I might
have.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I think that it’s extraordinarily important that we in computer science
keep fun in computing.  When it started out, it was an awful lot of
fun. Of course, the paying customer got shafted every now and then, and
after a while we began to take their complaints seriously. We began to
feel as if we really were responsible for the successful, error-free
perfect use of these machines. I don’t think we are. I think we’re
responsible for stretching them, setting them off in new directions, and
keeping fun in the house. I hope the field of computer science never
loses its sense of fun. Above all, I hope we don't become
missionaries. Don’t feel as if you’re Bible salesmen. The world has too
many of those already. What you know about computing other people will
learn. Don’t feel as if the key to successful computing is only in your
hands. What’s in your hands, I think and hope, is intelligence: the
ability to see the machine as more than when you were first led up to
it, that you can make it more.</em><br />
Alan Perlis, quoted in Abelson &amp; Sussman, <em>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although cs1120 has striven to be consistent with Perlis' spirit, when
you fly in an airplane, put your money in a bank, get LASIK eye surgery,
or live near a nuclear power plant, you would be worried if the people
who programmed those things agreed with Alan Perlis that their job was
not to make them "error-free". If you want to learn how to make robust
programs, take <em>CS2110: Software Development Methods</em> in the fall. This
courses focus on engineering, not computer science. That means the
course is mostly about ideas and methods for building programs that
behave reliably under constraints of cost and time (how long does it
take to get the program working, and how expensive will it be to change
it). The ideas and techniques you learn from cs2110 will enable you to
think about design more clearly (whether of software, or something
else), and will lead you to build more useful and exciting programs than
you would without them.</p></div>
